## My Learning Journey

*Over the last week, I participated in Biometry in the following ways:*

- I asked / answered **1** questions posed in class.

- I asked **3** questions in Slack.

- I answered **0** questions posed by other students on Slack.

- I came to Heather's office hours: **No**

- I came to Jose's office hours: **No**

- I met with Heather or Jose separately from office hours: **No**

*Anything not falling into one of the above categories?*  

> **No**

*On a scale of 1 (no knowledge) to 10 (complete expert), how would I rate my comfort with R programming after this week?* 

> **7**

*Any topics from last week that you are still confused about?*
